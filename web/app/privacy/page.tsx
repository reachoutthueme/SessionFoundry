          <p>
            SessionFoundry ("we", "us", "our") is a web app for planning and
            running workshops, collecting input from participants, voting on
            ideas, and exporting results.

          <p>
            Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the "data
            controller" is the party that decides why and how personal data is
            processed. We act as controller for facilitator accounts and
            participant data in sessions you run.

          <h2 className="text-base font-medium text-white">2. What data we collect</h2>
          <p>We collect only what we need to run the service.</p>

          <h3 className="font-medium">2.1 Facilitator account data</h3>
          <p>When you create an account or sign in as a facilitator, we collect:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Email address</li>
            <li>
              Password (stored as a secure hash through our authentication
              provider, not in plain text)
            </li>
            <li>Plan / subscription status (for example, "free", "pro")</li>
            <li>Basic app activity like which sessions you created</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <em>Why we need it:</em> to let you sign in, manage workshops,
            access exports, and enforce plan limits.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-medium">2.2 Workshop/session data</h3>
          <p>When you create a session we store:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Session name, description and metadata</li>
            <li>
              Activities you configure (for example, brainstorm prompts,
              stocktake prompts, timing, voting rules)
            </li>
            <li>Internal tags/labels you add</li>
            <li>Whether voting is enabled, budget, max submissions, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <em>Why we need it:</em> to run your workshop and show you results.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-medium">2.3 Participant data</h3>
          <p>When someone joins a session as a participant we collect:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>
              Display name they enter (real name, nickname, or group name - up
              to what they type)
            </li>
            <li>Which group/team they joined</li>
            <li>Their submissions (ideas, comments, suggestions)</li>
            <li>Their votes in voting activities</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <em>Why we need it:</em>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>
              to show input live to the facilitator and (in some cases) to other
              participants
            </li>
            <li>to calculate scores, consensus and results</li>
            <li>to let the facilitator export a summary after the workshop</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Note: participant display name plus their submission can be personal
            data under GDPR if it can be linked back to an identifiable person
            (GDPR Article 4(1)). We treat it as personal data.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-medium">2.4 Usage and technical data</h3>
          <p>When you use the app, we (or our hosting providers) may receive:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>IP address</li>
            <li>Browser/device info</li>

          <p>We currently do not run advertising trackers or behavioral ad pixels.</p>

          <h3 className="font-medium">2.5 Cookies / local storage</h3>

              An authentication/session cookie so that when you refresh the page

              Local storage flags (for example, remembering if you collapsed the

              <strong>Legitimate interests (GDPR 6(1)(f)).</strong> Preventing

            <strong>International transfers:</strong> Providers may process data
            in the EU or outside the EEA. If personal data is transferred to a
            country outside the EEA, GDPR requires appropriate safeguards (for

            rule), we may keep that limited record even after deleting the main

          <p>
            SessionFoundry is not designed for children under 16 to create
            facilitator accounts. Facilitators are responsible for how they
            invite participants and for obtaining appropriate consent where
            required.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you believe we collected personal data from a child without
            proper basis, contact us and we will review and, if appropriate,
            delete it.

          </h2>
          <p>
            One of SessionFoundry's core features is generating a summary/deck
            of all submissions, votes, and insights after a workshop. That
            export can contain personal data (like participant display names and
            what they said). Once you download an export, you - as the
            facilitator - are responsible for storing/using/sharing it in a
            GDPR-compliant way within your organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a participant asks for their data to be removed, we can delete it
            from our live systems (subject to legal exceptions), but we cannot
            automatically pull it back from files you have already exported and
            stored elsewhere.
